# VeriTime: A Digital Alarm Clock in Verilog

This project implements a simple yet functional digital alarm clock using Verilog HDL. It includes both the core design and a comprehensive testbench for simulation.

## 🕰 Features
- Digital clock logic (HH:MM:SS)
- Alarm setting and triggering mechanism
- Simulation-friendly testbench
- Modular design

## 📁 File Structure
- `Ghadi_Design.v` - Main Verilog file implementing the alarm clock logic
- `Ghadi_Testbench.v` - Testbench for validating the design
- `README.md` - Project documentation

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Open the files in any Verilog simulation tool (like ModelSim, Vivado, or Icarus Verilog).
2. Compile `Ghadi_Design.v` and `Ghadi_Testbench.v`.
3. Run the simulation to observe clock functionality and alarm behavior.

## 🎓 Educational Use
This project is ideal for learning:
- FSM (Finite State Machine) design
- Time-based event triggering in hardware
- Verilog module structuring and testbenching
